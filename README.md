##  About Me

Hi! I'm Danae Swart, a Second-Year Development and UI/UX student at Open Window. I love solving problems with code while integrating my knowledge of UI/UX to create projects that are both functional and visually engaging.

Beyond development, I‚Äôm also an artist who paints murals and anything creative that inspires me. I‚Äôm a big music lover and enjoy spending quality time with friends and family. 

My work spans web development, UX/UI design, painting, interactive applications, with a focus on crafting solutions that actually work‚Ä¶ most of the time  :)
